INTRODUCTION
=
This project is an ultra-simple demonstration of using [RVS_Spinner](https://riftvalleysoftware.com/work/open-source-projects/#RVS_Spinner) as a [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) project, where we simply include the `RVS_Spinner.swift` file as a Package.

USAGE
=
The project is already set up. The Spinner has been added to the project as an SPM module.

***NOTE:*** *This requires that the build be done with Xcode version 11.5, or greater.*
